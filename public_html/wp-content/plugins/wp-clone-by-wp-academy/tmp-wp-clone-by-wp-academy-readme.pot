"No WordPress backup plugin will work reliably on all hosts.  If you have any problems, try doing a \"Database Only\" backup (use \"Advanced Options\"), transfer the wp-content directory over with FTP, and then restore new site.  You should also deactivate and delete any page caching plugins (i.e. W3 Total Cache) before backup.\n"
"If you still have an issue, please post to the WordPress.org support forum where we support this plugin for free, and we'll respond on a  \"best-effort\" basis.  You can also try the Duplicator plugin http://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/ or All-in-One WP Migration https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/, both of which work pretty good, but are not as fast as WP Clone to migrate sites; or use the manual method described here http://members.wpacademy.com/ww3.htm?moving-wordpress.htm"
